# 🔥 Mini Turbojet Engine Project

This project is part of my undergraduate aerospace engineering work, focused on designing and fabricating a **miniature turbojet engine** capable of producing thrust through real combustion and turbine operation.

---

## 🚀 Overview
- **Type:** Single-shaft turbojet (based on automotive turbocharger)
- **Compressor:** Mahindra Turbocharger (45mm inducer)
- **Combustion Chamber:** 340mm length × 114mm diameter stainless steel
- **Fuel:** Aviation kerosene (Jet-A1 / Kerosene)
- **Fuel Pressure:** 100–300 PSI using DC pump system
- **Ignition:** 12V spark ignition powered by Li-ion battery
- **Afterburner:** 300mm extension for thrust enhancement
- **Cooling Air:** Bypassed air from compressor to primary zone

---

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights
- Designed and simulated using **SolidWorks** and **ANSYS Fluent**
- Real working flame tube and nozzle geometry
- Integrated **fuel spray nozzle (60° hollow cone)** for stable combustion
- Tested with self-priming DC fuel pumps and 12V ignition system
- Visualized airflow using 3D modeling and CFD tools
